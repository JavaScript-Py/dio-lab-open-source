I am a Computer Engineering student, looking for opportunities as a Developer. I have hands-on experience with a variety of technologies, including **Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Web Scraping, Git/Github, Linux Server, PostgreeSQL and MongoDB, and Django**. I also have knowledge in **CSS and HTML**.

 My interest in solving complex problems led me to complete a scientific initiation project focused on the democratization of knowledge about rockets, aiming to facilitate learning for less privileged people and laypeople.

Passionate about technology and always looking for improvement, I am participating in the DevOps bootcamp, offered by Botic√°rio, which allows me to always be up to date with new trends.
